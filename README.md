# AGNP_submission_commtr
This is the repository for AGNP model. Due to data value and sensitivity, it only contains partial dataset which is for testing. We also provide state_dict for trained models.
For trained random forest models which are too large to upload to github, readers can download here https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mxuaz_connect_ust_hk/ElZLLjf08XlJi0NUK7y4zq0B--rLjwDkVSma58SS1p-lRw?e=pDi4zZ and put them to Benchmark/logs, so that the model can be tested.
